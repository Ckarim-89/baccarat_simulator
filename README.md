# Baccarat Simulator

Eight-deck shoes can be simulated of rounds of baccarat. Thousands or more shoes can be simulated and exported to a .csv file and .db file.

A "shoe" is a casino term for the plastic device used to deal the cards, that roughly resembles the shape of a shoe. 

Data points being tracked are: banker total, player total, all cards drawn and their rank, the outcome, rounds in shoe, and winning streaks. 

The cut in the front of the shoe depends on the rank drawn of the first card. The cut in the back of the shoe is set at 14, but that value can easily be changed in the code.

Missing is another main module for analyzing the data to find meaningful conclusions and a strategy module, user input and GUI, and the ability to generate a .db file instead of a .csv.
