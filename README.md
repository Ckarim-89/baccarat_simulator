# Baccarat Simulator
This is a program that simulates entire shoes of baccarat, for statistical purposes.   
This program helps prove that patterns of wins and losses in baccarat don't have any impact on the next outcome.  
It's able to generate .csv and .db files of millions of hands of baccarat.  
Some useful data points are a game's outcome and what cards have been used in the shoe (for implementation of possible card counting systems)  

## Getting Started
Download all files into a folder and run main.py. This will bring up a GUI to set how many shoes of baccarat are to be simulated, where to save the .db file, and where to save the .csv file.

### Prerequisites
The requirements.txt file contains the requirements.
