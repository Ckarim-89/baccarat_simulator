A baccarat simulation that allows for different betting strategies to be tested. 

For example, if somone wants to bet the tie bet that pays 8 to 1 whenever the ratio of 10-value cards exceeds 25% with two decks left in an eight deck shoe. 

This simulation would allow someone to test various strategies with various bets to see if they can gain an advantage against a %5 commission charged when Banker win, which is what is commonly found in casinos.
