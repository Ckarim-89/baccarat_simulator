# Baccarat Simulator
This is a program that simulates entire shoes of baccarat, for statistical purposes.   
This program helps prove that patterns of wins and losses in baccarat don't have any impact on the next outcome.  
It's able to generate .csv and .db files of millions of hands of baccarat.  
Some useful data points are a game's outcome and what cards have been used in the shoe (for implementation of possible card counting systems)
