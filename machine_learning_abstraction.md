Absolutely! Implementing a machine learning approach can indeed optimize the betting strategy based on the deck composition and other variables you consider significant. Here's a high-level roadmap on how you can approach this:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Track the deck composition before every bet/hand.
   - Record the outcome of each hand (Banker win, Player win, Tie).
   - Log every bet made and the outcome for that bet (win/loss).

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Convert the tracked data into a format suitable for ML algorithms. Features could include percentages of each rank in the deck, recent win streaks, and more.
   - You might want to normalize/standardize certain features to make the ML model perform better.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Start with simple models to understand the nature of your data. Decision Trees or Logistic Regression can be a good starting point.
   - Gradually, you can experiment with more complex models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Machines, or even Neural Networks.

4. **Training and Optimization**:
   - Split your data into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
   - Use techniques like cross-validation to fine-tune your model.
   - You can use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize hyperparameters.

5. **Model Interpretation**:
   - Once the model is trained, interpret the feature importances to understand which factors are most predictive of a winning bet.
   - This will help you refine your betting strategy and understand the game better.

6. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Beyond traditional supervised learning, you could also look into reinforcement learning, where an agent (the player) learns the best action (betting strategy) by receiving feedback (rewards or penalties) from the environment (the game). This way, the model can learn an optimal strategy through many rounds of play.

Remember, the goal of using ML in this context is to identify patterns and strategies that might not be immediately obvious. However, always ensure that the model's predictions and suggestions align with logical and intuitive understanding of the game. It's a powerful tool, but like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how it's used!
